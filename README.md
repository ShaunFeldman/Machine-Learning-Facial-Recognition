A real-time facial recognition system that leverages deep learning to verify identities using a live camera feed.
It utilizes OpenCV for video processing and DeepFace for deep neural network-based face matching.

## Features
- **Real-Time Face Recognition**: Uses a pre-trained deep learning model to verify identities.
- **Threaded Processing**: Ensures smooth video playback while performing face verification.
- **Live Camera Feed**: Captures and processes video frames dynamically.
- **Deep Learning-Based Feature Extraction**: Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate facial embeddings.
- **Interactive UI Overlay**: Displays match results on the screen.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **DeepFace**
- **Threading for Performance Optimization**
